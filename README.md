•	The Student class holds information about each student (ID, name, age, gender).
•	The SimpleHashTable class implements basic hash table functionalities (add, get, remove) using a linked list to handle collisions.
•	There's a separate controller class (HelloController) that seems to manage a JavaFX GUI component (a label) in a different part of the application.
This software could serve as a basis for a student attendance tracker, enabling administrators or educators to manage student records and track attendance using a graphical user interface. If further functionality or specific use cases are needed, additional features could be implemented on top of this foundation
 
Error Handling:
•	The code includes some basic error handling, such as checking for valid input when adding a student (e.g., verifying the age is a number, ensuring gender is selected).
•	Alerts (showAlert method) are used to notify users about errors or unsuccessful operations, enhancing user experience by providing feedback.
Separation of Concerns:
•	The code attempts to separate different functionalities into distinct methods and classes, promoting modularity and easier maintenance.
•	For instance, the createStudentDialog method encapsulates the logic for creating a dialog box to add students.
ObservableList:
•	ObservableList is utilized to manage and update the content of ListView elements dynamically. Changes made to these lists automatically reflect in the associated UI components.
Potential Improvements:
•	Depending on future requirements, the software could be expanded with additional features like attendance recording, statistics generation, or data persistence (saving and loading student information).
GUI Design:
•	The GUI layout is simple and functional. Further enhancements could involve improving the visual design, adding more intuitive features, or refining the user interaction flow.
Testability:
•	While the code structure is relatively modular, additional unit tests could be implemented to ensure the correctness of data structure operations and user interactions.
Documentation and Comments:
•	Comprehensive comments and documentation within the code can improve readability and understanding, especially for developers maintaining or extending this application in the future.
Scalability:
•	As of now, the hash table and BST are initialized with fixed capacities. For a production-level application, dynamic resizing or more sophisticated data structures might be considered to handle larger amounts of data.
